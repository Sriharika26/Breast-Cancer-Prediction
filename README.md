# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
Built a machine learning model using Python, SVM, and KNN to classify breast tumors as benign or malignant. Focused on data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation. Utilized Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Streamlit for implementation, enhancing my skills in ML, data handling, and software development.
